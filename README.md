**About Dataset**
From kaggle, I use  only the dataset containing the history of nearly all of the real estate transactions concerning a single house/apartment in France from 2014 to 2022 from DVF.

This dataset is provided under a permissive licence, and is free to use for commercial applications. It has a vocation of helping research concerning the dynamics of real estate prices.

DVF stands for "Requests for property values" dataset, published and produced by the Directorate General of Public Finance, provides information on property transactions over the last five years in mainland France and the French overseas departments and territories, with the exception of Alsace, Moselle and Mayotte. The data contained in this database is derived from notarised deeds and cadastral information.
